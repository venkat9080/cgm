        <p><b>Chengam or Chengamma[1]</b> as on British records, is an important market town and a taluk headquarter[2] in the Foot hills of Eastern ghats[3] in Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu, India. Chengam is the gateway to the Chengam pass[4] in the Eastern ghats between Javvadhu hills to the north and Chennakesava hills to the south. The town is also the center for various industrial activities which includes Sathanur dam hydro-electric project,[5] Aavin milk processing plant[6] and Periya Kolappadi SIDCO estate.[7]</p>

<u>
<p><b>The book Malaipadukadam </u>in the Sangakkala literature mentions that Nannansei Nannan was a short-lived king who ruled from the Palkunrakottam hill with his capital as his capital. Many rare historical sources such as inscriptions and archeological finds have been found to prove this. Researchers also say that Nannan-ruled Navira Hill now refers to the Savvadu Hills and some to the mountains near the sea.
Initially Chengam was an assembly constituency (SC) of Tiruppattur (Lok Sabha constituency). In 2009 it became a part of the Tiruvannamalai Lok Sabha constituency.</b></p>
